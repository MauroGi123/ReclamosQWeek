# **App Name**: QWeek Claims Challenge

## Core Features:

- Round 1: Claims Matching: Match claim reasons with the corresponding number of occurrences. The order of choices should be randomized for each player.
- Round 2: Action Plan Connection: Match each claim reason to its correct action plan. The order of choices is randomized each time.
- User Authentication: Require users to enter their first name and last name, then verify that they haven't already played. Prevent multiple attempts by the same person.
- Feedback Display: After each round, highlight the correct matches in green and incorrect matches in red.
- Performance Tracking: Record the user's performance during the game and show a summary at the end.
